# Spending Data Anaylzing

This project demonstrates the use of summary tables to visualize data.

1. Total Spending by Category
   - Bar chart visualizing total spending amounts per category
   - Bills cover the highest total spending over any other category
2. Daily Spending Over Time
   - Line plot visualizing total spending per date
   - January 3rd displays a significant spike in spending

## Analysis

**1. Which category dominates total spending, and why?**
  - Bills dominates total spending because of its high magnitude despite its low frequency.

**2. Is spending consistent day-to-day, or are there spikes?**
  - Spending was consistent for the first 2 days of January, but there came a significant spike on the third day followed by lower-than-average spending for the next two days. Overall, spending is not so consistent day-to-day.

**3. If you were advising someone, what single insight would you highlight?**
  - If I were advising someone, the single insight I would highlight is to adapt spending habits to be tailored around the cost of Bills to minimize spikes like on January 3rd.
