# API Data Analysis

This project demonstrates how to process API-style JSON data using Pandas + Matplotlib. API response is loaded from JSON file.

1. Total Spending per Category
   - Horizontal bar chart visualizing total spending amounts per category
   - Bills covers the highest total spending over any other category
2. Average Transaction Size per Category
   - Horizontal bar chart visualizing average spending amounts per category
   - Bills covers the highest average transaction size
3. Summary Table
   - Despite the category "Food" having the highest transaction count, "Bills" has the highest total spending due to the difference in transaction sizes.

## Key Note

**Overall cost is driven by fewer, larger transactions rather than frequent small ones.**
